First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with 
React Native. To start Metro, run yarn react-native start inside the project 
folder:

`yarn react-native start`

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal inside the
project folder, then run the following:

`yarn react-native run-android`

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your
Android emulator shortly.
